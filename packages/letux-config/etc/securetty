# The /etc/securetty file allows you to specify which TTY devices the root user is allowed to login on.
# The /etc/securetty file is read by the login program usually /bin/login.
# Its format is a list of the tty devices names allowed, and for all others that are commented out
# or do not appear in this file, root login is disallowed.
# Disable any tty that you do not need by commenting them out # at the beginning of the line.
